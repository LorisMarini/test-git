Unfortunately our instincts don‚Äôt serve us well.

If we disagree with someone, our natural reaction is to push back. This can trigger even more defensiveness and before we know everyone start yelling (verbally or not) and we stop learning.

What a waste.

One way to reduce conflict and increase cooperation is to go WITH not AGAINST people who disagree with you. That is the essence of the Japanese martial arts form known as #Aikido.

I personally discovered this art only a few months ago, and I found it incredibly beneficial to regain balance and a bit of control in my personal and professional life.

Training to recognize conflict is the first step to stop reacting and start leading. Today I want to dive deeper into this less mainstream martial art. And what better way to do this than with a conversation with my Aikido sensei, Andrew Sunter.

Andrew Sunter is a professional aikido instructor who explores the boundaries of conflict resolution and applying the principles of non-attachment on the battlefield to everyday life.

Andrew lived and studied in Japan, and subsequently spent over two years as an Uchi-Deshi in an old-school dojo in Sydney's inner west, where he became an accidental Buddhist.

Andrew also had an extensive career as a computer programmer, technical writer, corporate trainer and project manager in the disciplines of Quality Management, Information Security Management, and document and records management.

He teaches Aikido at Aikido in Sydney!

So, what are some #leadership lessons we can take from Aikido?

Follow me as I learn from a black-belt 6th dan in episode 036 of Discovering Data - links below üòé

We tend to push back against the person we're disagreeing with. One way to resolve this is to go WITH and not AGAINST the conflict. That is the essence of Aikido. Helping us train to recognize conflict so that we can stop reacting and start leading is my Aikido sensei, Andrew Sunter.

We tend to push back against the person we're disagreeing with. One way to resolve this is to go WITH and not AGAINST the conflict. That is the essence of Aikido. Helping us train to recognize conflict so that we can stop reacting and start leading is my Aikido sensei, Andrew Sunter.
